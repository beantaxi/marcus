# This handy function is used to flexibly return a lambda, when passed
# an argument, a callable, or None
#
# If passed an argument, it creates a simple '==' lambda comparing a parameter to the argument
# If passed None, it creates a lambda which always returns True
# If passed a callable, it just returns the callable as is.
#
# The main use case for this function, is for functions like justOne(). Just one selects a single
# element from a list, and fails if <>1 matches are found.
def createFn (fnOrArg=None):
	if not fnOrArg:
		fn = lambda x : True	
	elif callable(fnOrArg):
		fn = fnOrArg
	else:
		arg = fnOrArg
		fn = lambda x: x == arg
	return fn


# Find exactly one element in a collection.
#
# fnOrArg can be None, or a Value, or a Callable.
#    None:     return the first argument in the collection (assuming it has one)
#    Value:    return the element equal to the value, if exactly 1 exists
#    Callable: return the one and only element, for which the callable returns true
#
# This function takes the place of a lot of nuisance code, eg getting an instance and 
# confirming there is only one instance with that name. AWS tends to name things via tags,
# which are key-value pairs, and usually uniqueness is not enforced, so many instances
# (or volumes, etc) can all share a name. Even though they shouldn't. justOne() takes
# care of validating possible multiple hits.

	if not hits:
